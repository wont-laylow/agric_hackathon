## Crop: Maize
## Disease: leaf_spot

### Symptoms
- Lesions begin as small dots with yellow halos, usually on lower leaves.
- Lesions elongate, become pale brown to gray, rectangular with blunt ends ("matchstick" appearance).
- Lesions may coalesce, killing leaves.
- Leaves appear grayish due to fungal spores.

### Cause
- Fungal infection (Cercospora zeae-maydis).

### Management
- Use tillage, crop rotation, and resistant hybrids.
- Apply fungicides if plants are infected early and conditions favor disease.
