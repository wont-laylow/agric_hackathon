## Crop: Tomato
## Disease: leaf_curl

### Symptoms
- Leaves are reduced in size, wrinkled, yellowed between the veins, and have margins that curl upward, giving a cup-like appearance.
- Flowers may appear but usually drop before fruit is set.

### Cause
- Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), primarily transmitted by the sweetpotato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and the biotype B (Bemisia argentifolii). The virus is not seed-borne or mechanically transmitted.

### Management
- Remove and discard symptomatic plants immediately to prevent spread.
- Remove weeds and avoid growing other solanaceous crops near tomatoes.
- Use UV-reflective mulch to deter whiteflies.
- Use insect exclusion screens for individual plants or screenhouses.
- Monitor crops for whitefly infestations and apply insecticides as needed, alternating chemical types to prevent resistance.
- Use TYLCV-resistant tomato varieties.
- Maintain healthy plants with proper irrigation and fertilization.
